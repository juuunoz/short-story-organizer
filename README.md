# short-story-organizer

made with LOVE

a minimalistic desktop thought organizer for writers (or anyone else with thoughts).
<ul>
  <li>left-click on an empty space to create a node</li>
  <li>right-click to delete the node</li>
  <li>ctrl+z to undo node deletion</li>
  <li>ctrl+s to save</li>
  <li>hold shift to open multiple nodes at once</li>
</ul>

planned future features:
<ul>
  <li>user interface, complete with a settings section to personalize to your little hearts content</li>
  <li>better textbox, comparable to the likes of every text editor ever, blinking indicator and all</li>
  <li>multiple save files</li>
  <li>support for mac and linux</li>
  <li>more customizability (colours, fonts, node shapes)</li>
</ul>
